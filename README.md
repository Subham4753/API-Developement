# Api Development


This is my code for API development using Flask.

It is a simple web API with different HTTP methods like GET,POST,PUT,DELETE.

The data to be read by this API is a dummy data stored in a dictionary that contains information like author,language and title of different books.

GET,POST,PUT,DELETE methods can retrieve, add, update and delete records(books) respectively from the dummy data.

This Web Service is also authenticated.

Language Used-Python

Framework used-Flask,which is a backend Web Framework for Python.

Tool used-Postman,which is a tool to test API.
